HPML Final Project
## Overview
High Performance Computing is based on a partition model where we use partitions to run multiple jobs simultaneously. This brings rise to the idea that we can use mobile devices as functional units to run a Machine Learning model that would require high computational power that can presently be provided by HPCâ€™s. Due to lack of resources running complex AI models on a single can be challenging. Therefore we would like to propose an approach where we use a cluster of smartphones that can share data with one another to train a model. We believe that this smartphone cluster can not only train the model with HPC level Test Accuracy but also work with real time data to deliver time-sensitive results.
## Code
Currently the Code is running on a Jupyter Notebook therefore just running the notebook would give a demonstration of our work.
## Results
When comparing to the inferencing time with the model hosted in the server vs the ones on the smartphones it was found that the server had a faster inferencing time BUT given the network latencies to communicate with the server the total time was approximately the same as what was achieved with the smartphones in the network.
